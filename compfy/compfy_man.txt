Guide for Configuring Compfy
   Config can be placed at either ~/.config/compfy.conf or ~/.config/compfy/compfy.conf
Basic Syntax
       Variables are formatted like this

              variable-name = value;

       All values require a semi-colon on the end as shown above.

       When declaring a animation-name you need to use double quotes like such

              animation-for-unmap-window = "slide-down";

       When using rule-sets there are two ways to provide windows to it.

       With almost every rule-set it will follow this syntax and structure.

              rule-set = [
                "class_g = 'foo'" # Select windows by classname
                "name = 'bar'" # Select windows by name
              ];

       In  the  example  you  replace  foo  with  the  WM_CLASS  which  can  be  found  using the xprop command provided by xorg-xprop
       ⟨https://archlinux.org/packages/extra/x86_64/xorg-xprop/⟩ on Arch and xorg.xprop on NixOS.

       Sometimes xprop will output multiple class names. If the first class name does not work, try the second one.

Options
corner-radius
       By default this is set to 12 in the sample config

       Adjusts the window corner rounding in pixels.

rounded-corners-exclude []
       By default this rule-set is empty

       Here you can declare rules of what windows will not have their borders rounded. This can be good for some games  that  go  full
       screen but still have rounded borders.

       Here is an example

              rounded-corners-exclude = [
                "class_g = 'Alacritty'",
              ];

corners-rule []
       By default this rule-set is empty

       Within  this  rule-set you can explicitly declare the corner-radius of individual windows based on their name or class name at‐
       tributes.

       It functions in a similar way to opacity-rule in that the number you put before the window name is the amount of  rounding  you
       want applied to that window.

       Currently you can only use number 1-100. This may be fixed in later updates.

              corners-rule = [
                "20:class_g    = 'Polybar'",
                "15:class_g    = 'Dunst'",
              ];

shadow
       By default this will be set to false in the sample config

       Enables shadows for windows.

       Shadows tend to be a bit finicky on some window managers, so make sure to play around with it and see what is best for you.

shadow-radius
       By default this is set to 12

       Shadow radius/roundness in pixels.

shadow-opacity
       By default this is set to 0.75 (0.0 ~ 1.0)

       Set the opacity of the window shadow.

shadow-offset-x
       By default this is set to -15 (-100 ~ 100)

       Set the offset of the shadow along the x-axis.

shadow-offset-y
       By default this is set to -15 (-100 ~ 100)

       Set the offset of the shadow along the y-axis.

shadow-color
       The color for shadows as a HEX code.

              shadow-color = "#101010";

shadow-exclude []
       By default this rule-set is empty

       Declare windows which will not render a shadow.

fading
       By default this is set to true in the sample config

       Fade windows in/out when opening/closing and when opacity changes

       Fading is required for unmap animations to work.

fade-in-step
       By default this is set to 0.03 in the sample config

       Opacity change between steps while fading in. (0.01 - 1.0)

       Increasing this value will result in faster fading in of windows.  Decreasing makes the fading in of windows take longer. (This
       does not means the animations take longer, just the fading).

fade-out-step
       By default this is set to 0.03 in the sample config

       Opacity change between steps while fading out. (0.01 - 1.0)

       Increasing  this value will result in faster fading out AND animating out of windows.  Decreasing this makes fading and animat‐
       ing out take longer.

fade-delta
       By default this is set to 5

       The time between steps in fade step, in milliseconds. ( > 0)

       Currently unsure what this does but it is recommended to keep it at the default.

fade-exclude []
       Empty by default

       Specify a list of windows that should not be faded.

              fade-exclude = [
                "class_g = 'foo'"
              ]

inactive-opacity
       By default this is set to 1.0 (0.0 - 1.0)

       Declares the opacity of unfocused windows.

frame-opacity
       By default this is set to 1.0 (0.0 - 1.0)

       Declares the opacity of window borders and title-bars.

inactive-opacity-override
       By default this is set to false (true/false)

       If this is not enabled then windows which have their opacity set in opacity-rule or wintypes will not be affected by  inactive-
       opacity. Enable this to fix that.

active-opacity
       By default this is set to 1.0 (0.0 - 1.0)

       Declares the opacity of focused windows.

active-opacity-exclude []
       By default this rule-set is empty

       A list of windows that should never have their opacity changed by active-opacity when focused.

inactive-exclude []
       By default this rule-set is empty

       A  list  of windows that should have their inactive-opacity set to whatever the active-opacity is. Unless the window is also in
       active-opacity-exclude then it will be set to 1.0 or if it is set in opacity-rule it will use the opacity set there as the  in‐
       active-opacity.

       Also excludes inactive dimming.

focus-exclude []
       By default this rule-set is empty

       Declare windows that should always be considered to be focused by the compositor.

opacity-rule []
       By default this rule-set is empty

       Declare windows that should have their opacity hard set. As an example. Where 95 is can be anything between (0 - 100)

              opacity-rule = [
                "95:class_g    = 'Alacritty'",
              ];

blur-background
       By default this is set to false

       Toggle background blurring

blur-method
       By default this is set to none

       Selects the blur method. Available options are:

              • none

              • kernel

              • gaussian

              • box

              • dual_kawase (most used)

blur-radius
       By default this is set to 3

       Sets the radius of the blur.

blur-strength
       By default this is set to 5

       Sets the strength/intensity of the blur.

blur-whitelist
       Defaults to true (true / false)

       Toggle whether you want to use blurring on a whitelist basis(blur-include) or a blacklist basis(blur-exclude).

blur-include
       By default this rule set is empty

       This acts a a whitelist for blurring the background of windows. See the example below.  Using a whitelist helps to reduce hard‐
       ware consumption.

              blur-rule = [
                "class_g = 'kitty'",
                "class_g = 'Emacs'",
                "class_g = 'Rofi'"
              ];

blur-exclude
       By default this rule set is empty

       When used with blur-whitelist = false; this will exclude specific windows from having their background blurred.

              blur-exclude = [
                "class_g = 'Firefox'"
              ];

       The part of the wiki you have probably all come for.

animations
       By default this option is set to true(true/false)

       Toggles whether animations should be used for windows

animation-stiffness
       By default this is set to 100

       Changes the stiffness of animations

       What stiffness basically is inferring is how much the window geometry will be stretched when opening/closing windows. It's best
       illustrated in the video below.

       With a higher stiffness the windows go to the final animation position faster resulting in a snappier looking transition.

animation-window-mass
       By default this is set to 0.5

       Changes the mass of windows

       Modifying the mass of windows makes them virtually heavier and therefore slower to animate.

animation-dampening
       By default this is set to 10

       Changes the dampening applied to windows during the animation

       This setting basically does what it says. It dampens the animation of windows.

       The more windows are dampened, the slower/softer they come into and out of view.

animation-clamping
       By default this is set to false (true/false)

       Toggles window clamping

       Stop  the animation from making the window exceed its set geometry. Shoutout to @thecodsman ⟨https://github.com/thecodsman⟩ for
       finding this out.

       Basically if you are using a animation setting that would make the window extend larger than it would be  after  the  animation
       has played then it will cut the animation off once the window reaches its physical geometry.

animation-for-open-window
       By default this is set to zoom

       Options: - fly-in Newly opened windows will fly in from a random position on the edge of the screen - zoom Newly opened windows
       will zoom in from the center point of wherever they were going to appear - slide-up Newly opened windows will slide up from the
       bottom of screen - slide-down Newly opened windows will slide down from the top of the screen - slide-left Newly opened windows
       will  slide  in from the right of where they are opened - slide-right Newly opened windows will slide in from the left of where
       they are opened - auto Newly opened windows will not have an animation

       Feel free to play around with these options to see which animation you prefer.

animation-for-unmap-window
       By default this is set to zoom

       Defines the animation for when windows are closed/killed

       Options: - fly-in Newly closed windows will fly out to a random position on the edge of the screen - zoom Newly closed  windows
       will  zoom  out from the center point of the window - slide-up Newly closed windows will slide up from where they were closed -
       slide-down Newly closed windows will slide down from where they were closed - slide-left Newly closed windows  will  slide  out
       from  the  right  of  where  they  are opened - slide-right Newly closed windows will slide out from the left of where they are
       opened - auto Newly closed windows will not have an animation

       Feel free to play around with these options to see which animation you prefer.

animation-open-exclude
       By default this rule-set is empty

       Define windows that will not render any open animation.

       Example

              animation-open-exclude = [
                "class_g = 'Alacritty'"
              ];

animation-unmap-exclude
       By default this rule-set is empty

       Define windows that will not render any closing animation.

       Example

              animation-unmap-exclude = [
                "class_g = 'Alacritty'"
              ];

Using wintypes.
       In picom you can set many options on the basis of what the windows 'type' is.

       Listed below are the available types.  I can't say what applications or windows all of these link to so you will have  to  play
       with them to find what works.

              wintypes:
              {
                desktop = {};
                dock = {};
                toolbar = {};
                menu = {};
                utility = {};
                splash = {};
                dialog = {};
                normal = {};
                dropdown_menu = {};
                popup_menu = {};
                tooltip = {};
                notification = {};
                combo = {};
                dnd = {};
              }

Wintype Options
       You can pass multiple options into one window type. Below is an example:

              wintypes:
              {
                normal = { shadow = true; fade = false; animation = "slide-down"; };
              }

       Below is all the options you can pass into wintypes.

   shadow
       Toggle shadows. ( true / false )

              wintypes:
              {
                popup_menu = { shadow = true; };
              }

   fade
       Toggle fading. ( true / false )

              wintypes:
              {
                popup_menu = { fade = false; };
              }

   focus
       If  focus was true, then that wintype would always be considered focus and therefore not be affected by inactive-opacity or in‐
       active-dim.  If false, it is always considered inactive/unfocused and then always applies those effects.

       ( true / false )

              wintypes:
              {
                menu = { focus = true; };
              }

   blur-background
       Toggle background blurring for windows under that type. ( true / false )

       Setting this to false will not actually do anything since blurring is done on a whitelist basis.

              wintypes:
              {
                desktop = { blur-background = true; };
              }

   full-shadow
       Toggle full shadow. ( true / false )

       Not sure what full shadow is at the moment.

              wintypes:
              {
                dropdown_menu = { full-shadow = false; };
              }

   redir-ignore
       Toggle redirect ignoring. ( true / false )

              wintypes:
              {
                dock = { redir-ignore = true; };
              }

   clip-shadow-above
       Toggle clipping shadows above a window. ( true / false )

              wintypes:
              {
                utility = { clip-shadow-above = true; };
              }

   opacity
       Set the opacity, both inactive and active. ( 0.0 ~ 1.0 )

              wintypes:
              {
                popup_menu = { opacity = 0.5; };
              }

   animation
       Set the open animation for specific wintypes. ( See animation-for-open-window under the Animations page for available options )

              wintypes:
              {
                popup_menu = { animation = "slide-right"; };
              }

   animation-unmap
       Set the close animation for specific wintypes. ( See animation-for-unmap-window under the Animations page for available options
       )

              wintypes:
              {
                tooltip = { animation-unmap = "fly-in"; };
              }

                                                                                                                              Compfy()
